# My link server

### The server side of [https://github.com/nmiz1987/my-link-site](https://github.com/nmiz1987/my-link-site)

I built this site because I wanted to build a repository where I can gather the links I like in one place.
To post new links, get existing links, update what is already there now, in short a server that will manage the Backend and a Frontend site that will pull all the sites through an API and display everything to the screen.

I set up an express mini-server written in node.js (because I removed all the options except GET), uploaded it to the railway website.

For database I use Monge atlas.
